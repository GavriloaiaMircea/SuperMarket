# Supermarket Management System

## Overview

The Supermarket Management System is a comprehensive desktop application developed using C# and WPF, with MySQL serving as the database backend. The application is designed to simulate and manage the inventory and operations of a supermarket, providing both administrative and cashier functionalities.

## Key Features

- **CRUD Operations:** Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the database, enabling efficient management of supermarket inventory.
- **Inventory Management:** Administrators can monitor and manage stock levels, ensuring the supermarket is well-supplied.
- **Supply Management:** The admin is responsible for restocking the store, with the ability to track and update inventory as needed.
- **Sales and Billing:** Cashiers can generate receipts for customers, streamlining the checkout process.
- **Financial Reports:** Administrators can view daily revenue generated by cashiers, analyze the largest sales receipts, and monitor overall financial performance.

## Technologies Used

- **C#:** The programming language used for developing the applicationâ€™s logic.
- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation):** The framework used for creating the desktop application's user interface.
- **MySQL:** The database system used for storing and managing application data.
